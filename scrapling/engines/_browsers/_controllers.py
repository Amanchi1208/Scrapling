        :param headless: Run the browser in headless/hidden (default), or headful/visible mode.
        :param disable_resources: Drop requests of unnecessary resources for a speed boost. It depends, but it made requests ~25% faster in my tests for some websites.
            Requests dropped are of type `font`, `image`, `media`, `beacon`, `object`, `imageset`, `texttrack`, `websocket`, `csp_report`, and `stylesheet`.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param useragent: Pass a useragent string to be used. Otherwise the fetcher will generate a real Useragent of the same browser and use it.
        :param cookies: Set cookies for the next request.
        :param network_idle: Wait for the page until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms.
        :param timeout: The timeout in milliseconds that is used in all operations and waits through the page. The default is 30,000
        :param wait: The time (milliseconds) the fetcher will wait after everything finishes before closing the page and returning the ` Response ` object.
        :param page_action: Added for automation. A function that takes the `page` object and does the automation you need.
        :param wait_selector: Wait for a specific CSS selector to be in a specific state.
        :param init_script: An absolute path to a JavaScript file to be executed on page creation for all pages in this session.
        :param locale: Set the locale for the browser if wanted. The default value is `en-US`.
        :param wait_selector_state: The state to wait for the selector given with `wait_selector`. The default state is `attached`.
        :param stealth: Enables stealth mode, check the documentation to see what stealth mode does currently.
        :param real_chrome: If you have a Chrome browser installed on your device, enable this, and the Fetcher will launch an instance of your browser and use it.
        :param hide_canvas: Add random noise to canvas operations to prevent fingerprinting.
        :param disable_webgl: Disables WebGL and WebGL 2.0 support entirely.
        :param load_dom: Enabled by default, wait for all JavaScript on page(s) to fully load and execute.
        :param cdp_url: Instead of launching a new browser instance, connect to this CDP URL to control real browsers through CDP.
        :param google_search: Enabled by default, Scrapling will set the referer header to be as if this request came from a Google search of this website's domain name.

        :param url: The Target url.
        :param google_search: Enabled by default, Scrapling will set the referer header to be as if this request came from a Google search of this website's domain name.
        :param timeout: The timeout in milliseconds that is used in all operations and waits through the page. The default is 30,000
        :param wait: The time (milliseconds) the fetcher will wait after everything finishes before closing the page and returning the ` Response ` object.
        :param page_action: Added for automation. A function that takes the `page` object and does the automation you need.
        :param extra_headers: A dictionary of extra headers to add to the request. _The referer set by the `google_search` argument takes priority over the referer set here if used together._
        :param disable_resources: Drop requests of unnecessary resources for a speed boost. It depends, but it made requests ~25% faster in my tests for some websites.
            Requests dropped are of type `font`, `image`, `media`, `beacon`, `object`, `imageset`, `texttrack`, `websocket`, `csp_report`, and `stylesheet`.
            This can help save your proxy usage but be careful with this option as it makes some websites never finish loading.
        :param wait_selector: Wait for a specific CSS selector to be in a specific state.
        :param wait_selector_state: The state to wait for the selector given with `wait_selector`. The default state is `attached`.
        :param network_idle: Wait for the page until there are no network connections for at least 500 ms.
        :param load_dom: Enabled by default, wait for all JavaScript on page(s) to fully load and execute.
        :param selector_config: The arguments that will be passed in the end while creating the final Selector's class.
        :return: A `Response` object.
